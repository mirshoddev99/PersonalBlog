Using dispatch method of Django's View with Mixins
For example, you could define a custom mixin like this:


class CustomUserMixin:
    def dispatch(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        user = request.user
        if not isinstance(user, CustomUser):
            return redirect("other_view")
        return super().dispatch(request, *args, **kwargs)
Then you can use this mixin in any views that require the user to be a CustomUser, like this:


class MyView(CustomUserMixin, View):
    def get(self, request):
        # view logic goes here
Using a mixin like this can make your code more modular and easier to understand, since it separates the custom behavior from the main logic of the view.




                                                Questioned by me
In here,         return super().dispatch(request, *args, **kwargs)
in this code get method of MyView is executed regular if user is instance of CustomUser model right. user will be redirected to other_view View if user is not instance of CustomUser model right


                                                Answered by ChatGPT
Yes, that's correct. In the dispatch method of the CustomUserMixin, the code checks if the current user is an instance of CustomUser.
If the user is an instance of CustomUser, then the super().dispatch(request, *args, **kwargs) line will call the dispatch method of the original view (in this case, MyView).
This will execute the get method of MyView (or post if the request is a POST request), and return the result.

If the user is not an instance of CustomUser, then the code will redirect the user to the other_view using redirect("other_view").
This will end the request processing for the current view, and send a redirect response to the user's browser. The get method of MyView will not be executed in this case.

So in summary, if the user is a CustomUser, the view will execute normally, and if the user is not a CustomUser, the user will be redirected to other_view without executing the main logic of MyView.
